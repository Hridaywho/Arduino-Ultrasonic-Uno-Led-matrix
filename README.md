# Arduino-Ultrasonic-Uno-Led-matrix
An Arduino Uno project that measures distance with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays it as a rising red LED bar on a MAX7219 8Ã—8 matrix. As an object moves from 30 cm toward the sensor, each row lights up one at a time. Range is fully adjustable in code. Simple wiring, open-source sketch, and easy to build for beginners.
